# CellChat code

<p>
The [tutorial](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat/blob/master/tutorial/CellChat-vignette.html) from the developers was followed with some additional changes. <br> </p>
<p>
  1. First the file named <i>"CellChat_Full_Comparison"</i> was followed for the seperate analysis of each of the experimental conditions <br>
  2. Second the file named <i>"CellChat_downstream_comparison"</i> <br>
  3. The files <i>"Heatmap_order"</i> and <br> <i>"Bubble_plot_scale_numbers" </i> are used instead of the netVisual_heatmap 
  and the netVisual_bubbleplot
</p>



The full dataset was LorNormalized. The CellChat analysis was performed seperately for the mutant and wildtype datasets. Afterwards the cellchat objects 
were merged and followed the tutorial for comparison analysis: https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat/blob/master/tutorial/Comparison_analysis_of_multiple_datasets.html
