# Prefrontal Cortex Alterations in a Mouse Model for the Schizophrenia-Associated 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome

<p> For this master's thesis project we wanted to detect pertubations in our dataset therefore we used MiloR (Dann et al., 2022) which is a tool based on k-nearest neighbor (kNN) graphs. This package is cluster-free base approach and is testing the differential abundance in single-cell RNA data. </p>

<p> We continued the analysis with detecting cell to cell interactions from our scRNAseq data using the CellChat tool (Jin et al., 2021)
 </p> 
 
 A graphical abstract of the tools that used is shown in Figure 1.

<p>
Two folders were prepared for each of the tools that were used. Under each folder there are scripts that followed for the analysis <br>
 including a readme file explainining the order of them. The folders shown within the code script refer to my local <br>
 folders in my computer.
