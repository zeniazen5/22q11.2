# Prefrontal Cortex Alterations in a Mouse Model for the Schizophrenia-Associated 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome

<p> For this master's thesis project we wanted to detect pertubations in our dataset therefore we used MiloR (Dann et al., 2022) which is a tool based on k-nearest neighbor (kNN) graphs. This package is cluster-free base approach and is testing the differential abundance in single-cell RNA data. </p>

<p> We continued the analysis with detecting cell to cell interactions from our scRNAseq data using the CellChat tool (Jin et al., 2021)
 </p> 
 
 A graphical abstract of the tools were used is shown in Figure 1.

scRNAseq downstream analysis from PFC of 22q11.2 heterozygous and wildtype mice. 
Two tools were used:
1. MiloR 
2. CellChat
